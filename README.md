## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Bootstrap, Node, MongoDB, Express, ChartJS, MVC

This applicatio was built with a crisp and responsive design using Bootstrap 5.2. Looks great on desktop and mobile as well as being compatible in all major browsers. Javascript client side as well as Node back end built with MVC paradigm to better organize and structure the application. EJS i used to ][']['This allows scalability for future additions and features. All data is sent to a MongoDB with the help of Express. Finally, ChartJS helps display all data in beautiful graphs for visualizing the data.

## Lessons Learned:

Using MVC Paradigm to setup a full stack CRUD app is very helpful for when I add features down the road. Easier to re-factor and make changes. I did enjoy EJS as it reminded me of directly using PHP inside HTML files but I am excited to try another templating language like handlebars or just to re-factor this into React. Praising MVC again as switching templating should be easier.
